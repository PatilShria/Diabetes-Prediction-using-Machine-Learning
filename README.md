# Diabetes-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning
Language used:- Python
Machine Learning Model used:- Support Vector Machine

We are building a system that can predict whether a person has diabetes or not with the help of Machine Learning. This project is done in Python. In this project, we use Support Vector Machine model for the prediction.


The dataset contains medical data of PIMA Indian women and is often used to predict whether a patient has diabetes based on diagnostic measurements. 
The dataset includes factors like Blood Glucose levels, insulin levels, BMI, Age, Pregnancies, Skin THickness, Diabetes Pedigree function.
